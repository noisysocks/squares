A web page made up of squares that can be coloured in. The “drawings” that you
make by colouring in squares are persisted and viewable (in real-time!) by
other strangers that visit the web page. Think of it all as a kind of crappy,
colourful, communal whiteboard.

I put this together one night when I was bored. It uses Firebase to persist the
squares and make everyting update in real-time.
